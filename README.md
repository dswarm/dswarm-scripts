# d:swarm scripts

a collection of useful commandline scripts for working with d:swarm

 * [generate_dswarm_projects_overviews.sh](generate_dswarm_projects_overviews.sh) generates various d:swarm projects overviews (i.e. different serializations (CSV, JSON, line-delimited JSON)) from d:swarm projects in a folder that have been exported with help of the [d:swarm tools](https://github.com/dswarm/dswarm-tools) (requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [json2csv](https://github.com/jehiah/json2csv))
